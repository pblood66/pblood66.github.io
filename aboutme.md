Hi, my name is Patrick Blood! I’m a junior studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University. I’m passionate about technology and enjoy building projects that challenge me to think critically about software design and problem-solving. I use this site to document projects I’ve built and reflect on what I’ve learned through practical coding experience.

I’ve worked extensively with Java, Python, and C++, and I’m comfortable using tools like Git in both Linux and Windows-based development environments. I believe that learning is a lifelong endeavor, and I strive to continuously improve my skills by exploring new concepts and building meaningful projects.

I’m always looking for opportunities to learn from others and work on meaningful software. Don't be afraid to send me an email!
